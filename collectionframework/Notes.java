package collectionframework;

/* collection frameworks are the groups of object and provide the interfaces and classes for 
fast manipulation of the data.

There are two types of collections in Java:
1) Collection Framework (CF): It provides interfaces only, no concrete implementation is provided by JVM.
2) Util Frameworks (UF): It provides both interface as well as concrete implementations.

Most commonly used collection frameworks are :
1- ArrayList
2- LinkedList
3- HashSet
4- TreeSet
5- HashMap
6- Hashtable
